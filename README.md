**The ultimate Todo App: Personal Playground**

Welcome to my personal playground! This repository is dedicated to building a comprehensive Todo App that incorporates various programming concepts and languages. The goal is to acquire and apply this knowledge in both my professional career and personal development

**Project Overview**
This Todo App serves as a practical project to explore and implement a wide range of programming concepts and languages. It is designed to be a dynamic and evolving project where I can experiment, learn, and refine my skills.

**Features**  
**Task Management:** create, read, update and delete tasks  
**Logging:** logging part of the application   
**Search feature:** Providing search capabilities for tasks based on keywords
